### General Info

This repo contains files I used to run experiments with protocols defined in the field of **Federated Analytics** for my master's project. 

See the book online [here](https://jjquek.github.io/indiv-project-exps/intro.html).

##### Federated Anaytics

Federated Analytics is a particular way of doing data science/analytics. 

The aim is to define protocols for computing target functions (e.g. aggregate mean) over user data whilst letting user data remain private. 

It is closely related to the field of **Federated Learning**, where the aim is to train prediction models using training data that remains private.

#### Experiments Run

- experiments related to the SAFE Protocol, as defined by Michael Huth and Amit Chulwaur in their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13640), *Secure Bayesian Federated Analytics for Privacy-Preserving Trend Detection*.

Consult the references for more information on these.

[maybe will include a technologies section]: # (update the TOC)

[go get the specific versions used for Python packages]: # (look it up)
