    "#### Cost Scenario In The Use-Case\n",
    "\n",
    "One way the model could be applied to the use case is in considering an individual who is deciding whether or not to use the mood app. For our use case, the compensation consists in benefitting from the services the app provides; the budget has already been spent and the app providers are going to run their differentially-private studies on the data of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this also highlights a difference between the scenarios described in the paper and our use case. In the various cost scenarios, users in a sense already 'bear' the data that could potentially be leaked as a result of participating in a study-- for instance, in the smoking data study cost scenario, the prospective participant is a smoker, and so it is possible that the data that *would* be in the dataset if they participated does get leaked to others even if they do not participate (e.g. if someone sees them smoking).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the mood app however, if users choose not to use the app, then they would not, strictly speaking, 'bear' the data that *would* be in the database if they used it. For instance, if the mood app wants to track what resources they are using, if they do not use the app, then they would not fear the exposure of that data (because they haven't used the app!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, we can still identify a similar risk they consider in whether to use the app: if information about their private mental or emotional state gets leaked. That is what the app interactions approximate, and individuals will want to weigh this risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this technicality out of the way, we can return to considering the cost scenario. The decision is whether or not to participate in their studies/study by using the app yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "We follow a similar procedure as in the paper to first consider the cost scenario. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the first step brings us to an issue to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Estimating Base Cost In Our Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "As the authors note in the section on making further refinements to their model (section 9.2, p23), the model does not describe how to determine the base cost for individuals. Moreover, there does not seem to be a totally rigorous way to do this especially in our use case. How might we quantify a privacy loss that results from using the app? It is hard to definitely say. As the authors note, psychological research also suggests that humans can be biased in reasoning about uncertain events. (p23)\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, here is one suggestion. A cost scenario the authors consider is one in which individuals are deciding whether or not to participate in a study that involves their movie rating data. The base cost envisioned in that scenario is the probability that, though they do not participate, a person's movie rating records are nonetheless released multiplied by the punitive damages specified by the Video Protection Act of 1998 (at least $2500).\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems that individuals would fear disclosure of their inputs in a mood app for similar reasons, but to far greater degrees. So, let us stipulate the individual estimates that it would be 10 times as bad to have their information about their mental or emotional state leaked. This seems possible-- the data revealed by how one has used a mood app is presumably far more personal than however they have rated movies they might have watched.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we now need to determine what the probability of this happening if they do not use the app. As with the author's assessment of the movie rating case, disclosure seems to be a 'low probability event' i.e., 0.0001 (p 14). \n",
    "\n",
    "Above we saw that our study parameters gave us an upper bound on the base cost $E$ as $182.42$ (2 dp.). Given the estimated base cost of this scenario ($0.0001 * 25000 = 2.5$), the study is feasible (provided we have the requisite $N$).\n",
