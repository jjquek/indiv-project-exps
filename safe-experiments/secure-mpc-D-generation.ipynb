    "## Test Run of Proposed Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the security deficiencies of using Python's `random` module, here is an alternative way for $N$ users to generate a shared random $D$ value for each run of the SAFE Protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "* each user uses the `secret` module (which uses a Crytographically-Secure PRNG) to generate a binary string.\n",
    "* this binary string is mapped to a float (in the case of `0` or `nan`, some default float value is used as their secret share.)\n",
    "* users do additive secret sharing of their float values to come up with a shared $D$ value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** the binary string generated from the `secret` module needs to be long enough for security (i.e., more than 256 bits), but we can only convert strings of 32 bits to floats. So, we randomly **sample** 32 bits from each bit-string generated by the CPRNG before converting it to some float.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--Initially, I thought I'd be able to use additive secret sharing to generate a shared D value. But turns out that (1) the Pysyft .share() method's API is nowhere to be found on the internet, (2) moreover sources seem to indicate that the PySyft wrapper for PyTorch is deprecated? At least for the secure MPC side of things. (3) Even if I could use the .share() method it doesn't seem like I could pass in more than 5 values without doing some really ugly hard coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems like a more promising approach: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-secure-multiparty-computation/#:~:text=Some%20techniques%20used%20in%20secure%20Multiparty%20computation%20are,one%20gate%20at%20a%20time.%20...%20More%20items\n",
    "\n",
    "Each user's random float (via mapping a binary string to some float) is their secret. They split this secret and distribute the shares to all other users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the users jointly calculate the average of the secret values. This constitutes the rounds D value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main drawback of this approach, and secure MPC protocols in general, is the communication overhead. For N users, each user has to communicate with N-1 other users. So, we have O(N^2) growth in communication overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, this method may only be acceptable for smaller settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another consideration: in order to perform multi-party additive sharing, each user needs to have a shared and secret randomness parameter. This would be a large prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not clear that Tsung's protocol allows for users to jointly generate some large prime... \n",
    "\n",
    "What if a single user generated and broadcast the prime to all others for the round? ... Haiz. \n",
